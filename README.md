# Terrain-Generation-using-GANs

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for procedural terrain generation, a technique traditionally reliant on handcrafted algorithms. Leveraging recent advancements in deep generative modeling, we aim to learn and synthesize realistic terrains based on real-world data.

## Objectives
- **Automatic Terrain Creation:** Generate realistic terrains with minimal user input, reducing the need for manual design.
- **Data-Driven Approach:** Utilize real-world data to create terrains that are statistically similar to real-world landscapes.
- **Increased Realism:** Produce high-resolution photorealistic terrains to enhance the visual quality of games or simulations.

## Methodology
The project utilizes openly available satellite imagery from NASA to train two types of GANs:
- **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network):** Learns the underlying distribution of terrain heights.
- **pix2pix GAN:** Translates a low-resolution "altitude image" (representing desired terrain features) into a high-resolution photorealistic terrain image.

By combining these networks, the project aims to achieve its objectives effectively.

## Future Work
- **Joint Training:** Investigate the potential benefits of joint training of DCGAN and pix2pix GAN for improved results.
- **Segmentation Pipelines:** Integrate segmentation pipelines to classify different terrain types (e.g., forests, mountains).

## Results
Generated textures from both GANs during training and testing phases are available in the repository.

## Conclusion
This project represents a preliminary step towards GAN-based procedural terrain generation. It holds promise for automating terrain creation and improving the realism of virtual environments in games, simulations, and other applications.
